# About the project

This project is a tutorial made by [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hYYGbV60Vq3IXYNfDk8At1) The tutorial video of this project is [here](https://youtu.be/ixOcve5PX-Q).

The project is a tutorial about learning vue 3 JS with the Option API by creating a web form.

I also used [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to deploy the website's project instead of Github Pages.

The project is only used for educational purposes and for personal purposes.

# What I learnt

I learnt how to use Vue 3 with the Options Api by creating a simple web form,
of an email, password, and skills, with a checkbox to agree terms and conditions.
I also added some password validation and styling to make it beautiful and 
UX/UI friendly. I learnt about v-models, events emitters and modifiers, and 
much more.
